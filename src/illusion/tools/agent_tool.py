    name = "agent"
    description = """Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Agent tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
- explore: For broad codebase exploration and research (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, Bash)
- plan: For planning implementation approaches (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, Bash)
- code-reviewer: For reviewing code changes (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, Bash)
- test-runner: For running tests (Tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, Read)
- general-purpose: All tools available

When using the Agent tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.

When NOT to use the Agent tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read tool or the Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use SendMessage with the agent's ID or name as the `to` field. The agent resumes with its full context preserved. Each Agent invocation starts fresh — provide a complete task description.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Agent tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
- You can optionally set `isolation: "worktree"` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; if changes are made, the worktree path and branch are returned in the result.

## When to fork

Fork yourself (omit `subagent_type`) when the intermediate tool output isn't worth keeping in your context. The criterion is qualitative — "will I need this output again" — not task size.
- **Research**: fork open-ended questions. If research can be broken into independent questions, launch parallel forks in one message. A fork beats a fresh subagent for this — it inherits context and shares your cache.
- **Implementation**: prefer to fork implementation work that requires more than a couple of edits. Do research before jumping to implementation.

Forks are cheap because they share your prompt cache. Don't set `model` on a fork — a different model can't reuse the parent's cache. Pass a short `name` (one or two words, lowercase) so the user can see the fork in the teams panel and steer it mid-run.

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an `output_file` path — do not Read or tail it unless the user explicitly asks for a progress check. You get a completion notification; trust it. Reading the transcript mid-flight pulls the fork's tool noise into your context, which defeats the point of forking.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results in any format — not as prose, summary, or structured output. The notification arrives as a user-role message in a later turn; it is never something you write yourself. If the user asks a follow-up before the notification lands, tell them the fork is still running — give status, not a guess.

## Writing the prompt

When spawning a fresh agent (with a `subagent_type`), it starts with zero context. Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

Terse command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.

Example usage:

<example>
user: "What's left on this branch before we can ship?"
assistant: <thinking>Forking this - it's a survey question. I want the punch list, not the git output in my context.</thinking>
Agent({
  name: "ship-audit",
  description: "Branch ship-readiness audit",
  prompt: "Audit what's left before this branch can ship. Check: uncommitted changes, commits ahead of main, whether tests exist, whether the GrowthBook gate is wired up, whether CI-relevant files changed. Report a punch list - done vs. missing. Under 200 words."
})
assistant: Ship-readiness audit running.
</example>

<example>
user: "Can you get a second opinion on whether this migration is safe?"
assistant: <thinking>I'll ask the code-reviewer agent - it won't see my analysis, so it can give an independent read.</thinking>
Agent({
  name: "migration-review",
  description: "Independent migration review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: "Review migration 0042_user_schema.sql for safety. Context: we're adding a NOT NULL column to a 50M-row table. Existing rows get a backfill default. I want a second opinion on whether the backfill approach is safe under concurrent writes - I've checked locking behavior but want independent verification. Report: is this safe, and if not, what specifically breaks?"
})
